Before the first execution, run the script *start.m* to setup the needed paths.
All programs should then be executable from anywhere in the directory *Programmes*.

# Aggr
Final simulator version is in ./PartClasses, files not in this folder are incremental version of the simulator and all calibration done for the aggregation model.
## PartClasses
Object classes representing particles and main simulator.

# CalledFunc
Subfunctions used in models or to treat input and output data.

# EstimationRhop
Estimation of one or two particles density for which the model best fit given data.
The model (Eulerian or Lagrangian) is tested for a range of particle densities given as an input by the user. Model's results are compared to *in-situ* data, the error between the model and the data is computed for each value of particle density. The result with the minimal error is considered as the best particle density to a priximate the data.

For an estimation of two densities, the simulations's results for one density are added two by two then compared to data.

Ploted figures : 
- all concentration profiles tested
- error for each tested profile
- final concentration profile best fitting the data
